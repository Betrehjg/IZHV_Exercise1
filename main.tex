\section*{\centering Analysis}
Primary genre of the game is exploration-adventure - main goal is to explore local planetary system and uncover reason why the star is going supernova and maybe find way to prevent it.

Exploration is enhanced by piloting spaceship which is the main means of transport throughout the game. Multiple puzzles located in various places are used to tell the story and help guide player to other places of interest. 

After certain period of time the whole planetary system is destroyed by star going supernova and player start again from beginning only with knowledge gained previously. This roguelike gameplay is supporting the puzzle part of the game because each planet and places on them changes with time, so some puzzles are accessible only during certain periods of time. After each run players have more knowledge and instead of aimlessly exploring can target specific places and solve the world ending crisis. 

Minimalist cartoon visuals are enhancing the mystery atmosphere of the game and its indie nature.
